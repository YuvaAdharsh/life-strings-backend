Deployment
Environment Setup

Set NODE_ENV=production in your environment
Configure CORS_ORIGIN to match your frontend domain
Set a secure AUTH_TOKEN for protected endpoints
Ensure the server has write permissions to the data/ directory

Recommended Hosting Platforms

Heroku: Easy deployment with git integration
Railway: Modern platform with simple setup
DigitalOcean App Platform: Scalable with database options
AWS EC2: Full control and customization
Vercel: Serverless deployment (may require modifications)

Security Considerations
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes:

Authentication: Currently uses basic token authentication. Consider implementing JWT or OAuth for production.
Rate Limiting: Not implemented. Consider adding rate limiting for production use.
Input Sanitization: Basic validation is in place, but consider additional sanitization.
HTTPS: Ensure HTTPS is enabled in production.
Environment Variables: Keep .env file secure and never commit it to version control.

CORS Configuration
The API is configured to accept requests from:

http://localhost:3000 (development)
Your GitHub Pages URL (as specified in CORS_ORIGIN)

Update the CORS configuration in server.js for additional domains.
Monitoring and Logging

Server logs include feedback submissions with scores
Health check endpoint for uptime monitoring
Error logging for debugging
Analytics tracking for usage insights
